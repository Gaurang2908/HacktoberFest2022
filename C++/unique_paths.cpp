/**
 * LOGIC: If you take 2x3 grid then the possible values to reach end is

 * DRR
 * RDR..
 * 
 * - Hence we understand that 2R and 1D must be there wherever it comes
 * So for larger NxM also it will work
 * 
 * - Hence, first check how many blanks will be there
 * (n-1) + (m-1)
 * 
 * - Now, TotC(n-1) or TotC(m-1) anyone of them will work
 * - This is solution using combination
